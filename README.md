# arkeros' dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. Works on *nix, optimized for macOS.

My dotfiles are now managed with [Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) so you can easily install and uninstall parts of it with ease. This should satisfy those who find my setup and ask for help installing it. ^^
