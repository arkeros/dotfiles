# arkeros' dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. Works on *nix, optimized for macOS.

My dotfiles are now managed with [Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) so you can easily install and uninstall parts of it with ease. This should satisfy those who find my setup and ask for help installing it. ^^

Install with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/arkeros/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Install with curl:
```
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkeros/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
